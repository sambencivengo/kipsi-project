# kipsi-project

I had a great time working on this project. I hope you enjoy checking it out!

### Getting Started

#### Backend

-   To get started create a new local PostgreSQL database, then create a `.env` file.
-   In the `.env` file, add the variable DATABASE_URL with your local PostgreSQL db

-   Install the server's dependencies by running `yarn` at the root of the repository
-   Run the migrations to set up your database with `yarn migration:up`
-   Seed the database with `yarn seed`
-   Start the server with `yarn dev`

#### Frontend

-   open up a second terminal
-   `cd` into the `/client` directory and run `yarn` to install the frontend dependencies
-   run `yarn dev` in this new terminal window

That should be all you need to get started. If you have any questions or run into any issues, please emails me at sambencivengo@gmail.com
