# kipsi-project

I had a great time working on this project. I hope you enjoy checking it out!



### Getting Started

#### Backend
- To get started create a new local PostgreSQL database, then create a `.env` file.
- In the `.env` file, add the variable DATABASE_URL with your local PostgreSQL db

- Install the server's dependencies by running `yarn` at the root of the repository
- Run the migrations to set up your database with `yarn migration:up`
- Seed the database with `yarn seed`
- Start the server with `yarn dev`

#### Frontend
- open up a second terminal
- `cd` into the `/client` directory and run yarn to install the frontend dependencies
- run `yarn dev` in this new termincal window=


That should be all you need to get started. If you have any questions or run into any issues, please emails me at sambencivengo@gmail.com
